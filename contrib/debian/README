This directory contains files used to package popcoind/POPCoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile popcoind/POPCoin-Qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

POPCoin: URI support
--------------------

popcoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install popcoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your popcoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/bitcoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

popcoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
